Module 3 - PyBank and PyPoll challenges

For PyBank and PyPoll - I looked up the max and min functions on StackOverflow to make sure my syntax was correct in using them.  I also looked up how to round numbers to specific decimal places from StackOverflow.  For the majority of the code I based it on the lessons from class, specifically looking at the census class activity when structuring my PyPoll code. 

Classmate Ardavan also posted code for exporting to text file through the classroom Slack which I consulted when writing the exporting lines of code.
